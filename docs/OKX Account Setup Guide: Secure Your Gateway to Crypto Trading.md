# OKX Account Registration Guide

## Introduction

Create your OKX account with a valid mobile number and email address. Ensure both can receive verification codes. Post-registration identity verification is mandatory (users must be 18+). Unverified accounts cannot trade crypto, deposit/withdraw funds, transfer assets, borrow, or use advanced features.

**Note**:  Invitation codes are optional but may unlock exclusive rewards. Registration remains fully functional without one.

## Using an Invitation Code?

Register via a friendâ€™s invitation link/code to share mutual rewards (e.g., bonus USDT).

- **Important**: Invitation relationships are validated solely through codes. Double-check entries.

---

## Troubleshooting Invitation Links

If links fail, manually adjust domains. Example:

Change the link from:  
`https://www.ouxyi.clinic/join/1234567`  
to  
`https://www.okx.com/join/1234567`,  

and open it in your browser.

**Note**: Regional restrictions may block access. Try network switching or retry later. Stay alert to phishing risks.

---

## Mobile Registration Tips

- Use your own registered numberâ€”third-party numbers fail verification.

- Must link a personal email for system notifications and account recovery.

---

## Email Registration Guidelines

Supported providers: QQ, 163, Sina, Outlook. Ensure inboxes receive OKX alerts, verifications, and reset links.

**Reminder**: Both mobile and email are mandatory for registration.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Errors

### 1. Incorrect Personal Information
Confirm mobile/email accuracy and formatting (e.g., country codes).

### 2. Network Connection Issues
Switch between Wi-Fi and cellular data. Retry in stable signal zones.

### 3. Duplicate Information
If the system notifies you that the phone number or email is already registered, confirm whether you already have an account:
- If yes, retrieve your password and log in.
- If no, contact OKX support for further assistance.
